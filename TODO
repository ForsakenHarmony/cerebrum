 * merge back changes on avr/generate.py to msp/generate.py
 * generate the ganglion tree statically on connect
 * add timeouts in the device-side serial protocol parser
 * implement more efficient accessor generation
 * remove avr/util.c (it's nice, but it's also not needed anymore)
 * share code between avr and msp
 * inside generate.py, implement double buffering support for modulevar()
 * pass the serial device where the avr is to be found down to the avr Makefile
 * convert protocol to little endian
 * automate the generation of marshaling/unmarshaling code on the device side?
 * remove empty members?
