 * add timeouts in the serial protocol parsers
 * implement more efficient accessor generation
 * add device selection to the avr programmer w/ udev rules
 * remove avr/util.c (it's nice, but it's also not needed anymore)
 * inside generate.py, implement double buffering support for modulevar()
 * automate the generation of marshaling/unmarshaling code on the device side
 * pass the serial device where the avr is to be found down to the avr Makefile
 * convert protocol to little endian
