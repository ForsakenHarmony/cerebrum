 * implement efficient accessor generation
 * add device selection to the msp programmer w/ udev rules
 * remove avr/util.c (it's nice, but it's also not needed anymore)
 * inside generate.py, implement double buffering support for modulevar()
 * pass the serial device where the avr is to be found down to the avr Makefile
